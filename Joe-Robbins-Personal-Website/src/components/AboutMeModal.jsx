                <strong>My Background: </strong>I spent the last 5 years working in the fields of exercise physiology/health & wellness, spinal cord injury recovery, and clinical research. After doing a Masters thesis in a biomechanics lab utilizing advanced motion capture technology, and working in a clinical research laboratory, I developed a deep appreciation for the software that goes into human performance and accessibility alike. I plan on taking my background in exercise and research and merging it with software engineering; to create applications and software that at their core, help people.
